# Auction Site - Flask Web Application
## Project Overview üìå
This project is a web-based auction system built using Flask. The application allows users to browse auction items, place bids, and interact with auctioned goods. The system supports user authentication, item categorization, bid management, and question-answer functionalities for items. Additionally, the system implements email notifications for outbid alerts and bid confirmations.

## Features ‚ú®
### Auction Item Management
* Users can create, update, and delete auction listings (admin only).
* Items are categorized into predefined categories.
* Each item includes title, description, seller, image, starting price, start time, and end time.

### Bidding System
* Users can place bids on auction items.
* The system validates bids (ensures the new bid is higher than the previous one).
* Automated email notifications are sent when a user is outbid.

### User Authentication & Authorization
* Flask-Login is used for session-based authentication.
* Users can log in and log out.
* Role-based access control: Admin, Superuser, and Regular Users.
* User data is securely stored in JSON format.

### Additional Features
* Question & Answer Section ‚Äì Users can ask questions about auction items, and admins can respond.
* Search, Sorting, and Filtering ‚Äì Find auctions by category, keyword, or auction status.
* Likes & Dislikes ‚Äì Users can like/dislike auction items.
* Email Notifications ‚Äì Get notified about bidding activity.
